# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## The first rule of frontend web development:

## keep the console open all the time

## Let us repeat this together: I promise to keep the console open all the time during this course, and for the rest of my life when I'm doing web development.

```zsh
$ ~/development/study/fs_helsinki/exercises/part1$ npm create vite@latest courseinfo -- --template react
```
